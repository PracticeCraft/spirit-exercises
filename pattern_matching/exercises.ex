  Exercises for "Pattern Matching"
  Guide Page: <https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/pattern-matching.html>

  Exercises to practice using `=` in basic pattern matching. 

  Please note:
  - If you haven't noticed in the documentation, the return value of a pattern
  matching expression is the value on the right side of the `=` operator. Keep
  that in mind when solving the exercises and checking the tests.
  - Try to use pattern matching in every function, even if it can be solved in
  other ways.

  Uses pattern matching to check if the given value is 42.

  ## Examples
